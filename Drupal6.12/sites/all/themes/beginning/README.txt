beginning drupal 6.x theme, 
created by robin / biboo[dot]net / nekodesign[dot]net

---------------
The beginning theme has to be considered as another blank canvas for theme developers (like framework http://drupal.org/project/framework, zen http://drupal.org/project/zen).

Use beginning as a starting point to help facilitate your theme development. Simply add your own background images and you're done !

Some feature :
---------------
-- 960 px centered fixed width layout (supporting screen resolutions of 1024 pixels and up). 
-- Multi-column support (0, 1 or 2 sidebars / auto resizing) 
-- Source-ordered, using negative margin (the content comes before the left and right sidebars in the XHTML source for increased accessibility and SEO.) 
-- 5 extra regions
-- Supported features : logo, favicon, name, slogan, mission, comment_user_picture, primary_links, secondary_links, search_box
-- W3C standards-compliant : it validates XHTML 1.0 Strict / CSS 2.1 
-- Cross-browser compatible : works in Firefox 2.0, IE 7, Opera 9, Netscape navigator 9, Safari 3. 
-- It is inspired from deco http://drupal.org/project/deco (header area), zen http://drupal.org/project/zen (negative margin, source ordered), Alek 2.0 http://drupal.org/project/alek_2_0 (3 footer regions) 

Not supported :
-- IE6 browser
-- search box feature in header area (currently displayed in the left sidebar)
